Useful for protecting tokens, like templates in HTML, from being mutated when the string is transformed in some way, like from a formatter/beautifier.

**Example without** `preserve`

Let's say you want to use [js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify) on a string of html with Lo-Dash/Underscore templates, such as: `<ul><li><%= name %></li></ul>`:

js-beautify will render the template unusable (and apply incorrect formatting because of the unfamiliar syntax from the Lo-Dash template):

```
<ul>
  <li>
    <%=n ame %>
  </li>
</ul>
```

**Example with** `preserve`

Correct.

```
<ul>
  <li><%= name %></li>
</ul>
```

For the record, this is just a random example, I've had very few issues with js-beautify in general. But with or without js-beautify, this kind of token mangling does happen sometimes when you use formatters, beautifiers or similar tools.
